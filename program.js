/* things to add and sort out:
* you need to fix the remove function so that it works with the current and next index's. Current problems are that the pizza counters are counting through the index's not the customer numbers, so it displays pizzas that have already been removed. Also new pizzas are assigned the same customer numbers because the array length gets shorter. Maybe use delete instead of splice? (doesn't work, maybe can't iterate properly over undefined element in array).
* you need too sort out how the display current pizza and the pizza ready functions interact when there is 
only one pizza at the beginning add order numbers to pizza array */
