# pizza-program

At the moment just a program that runs in a terminal through which people can add their names and what pizza they want. It then cycles through the array and can display where it is at for the people making the pizzas.
I will add more functionality like the heat from the oven, average wait times, endless things.
Probably the whole thing would function way better as an app or website but I don't know how to do that at the moment.
